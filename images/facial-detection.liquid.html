      <h2>Detailed Instructions </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Begin by carefully examining the entire image. </li>
        <li> When you indentify a human face, draw a rectangle using your mouse over it</li>
        <li>Make sure the box does not cut into the face and leave a 2 - 3 pixel margin around the face</li>
        <li>
          When there are overlapping faces, draw a box around each face,
          include all contiguous parts of the target in the box.
          Do not include parts that are completely overlapped by another object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not include parts of the target that cannot be seen,
          even though you think you can interpolate the whole shape of the face</li>
        <li>If the face goes partially off screen, still label up to the edge of the image</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- The <short-instructions> tag allows you to specify instructions that are displayed in the left hand side of the task interface.
    It is a best practice to provide good and bad examples in this section for quick reference. -->

      Draw boxes around each human face in this image.
